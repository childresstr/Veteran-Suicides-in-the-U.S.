# Veteran-Suicides-in-the-United States, 2017
*Final Project for GHY 3814: Web Mapping and GIS*

As a Veteran, and GIS user relatively familiar with web cartography and map design, I was contacted by CBS News to assist with a [news article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/suicide-among-veterans-higher-states/) published in 2017. The story draws light to the troubling statistics concerning veteran suicide and the disproportionate rates in some states. Though the article dates to 2017, my contact at CBS informed me that with this being an election year the story still holds significant relevance and should be brough to the attention of the new administration.They felt a visual aid to the article was necessary therfore I created a proportional symbol map using [data](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/suicide_prevention/data.asp) gathered from the United States States Department of Veteran Affairs.
