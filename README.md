# Veteran-Suicides-in-the-United States, 2017
*Final Project for GHY 3814: Web Mapping and GIS*

As a Veteran, and GIS user relatively familiar with web cartography and map design, I was contacted by CBS News to assist with a [news article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/suicide-among-veterans-higher-states/) published in 2017. The story draws light to the troubling statistics concerning veteran suicide and the disproportionate rates in some states, specifically in the west. Though the article dates to 2017, my contact at CBS informed me that with this being an election year the story still holds significant relevance and should be brought to the attention of the new administration. They felt a visual aid to the article was necessary, therefore I created a proportional symbol map using [data](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/suicide_prevention/data.asp) gathered from the United States States Department of Veteran Affairs. The circle symbology proportionally represents the number of veteran suicides for each state with the smaller the circle the lower the number of suicides. Interactivity in the map takes the form of hovering over a circle, which changes the color, to clicking a circle, which returns a popup with the exact number for that particular state. There is further circle representation found in the legend along with a container on the opposite side of the page which houses additional context concerning the map message. I chose a black and white base map, not only to provide significant contrast, but the lack of color in the background correlates with the dark topic at hand. The three main colors applied utilize [triadic color harmony](https://convertingcolors.com/css-gradient/view/6A0DAD753600005F68.html) which entails evenly spaced colors found on the color wheel that form the shape of a triangle. I hope this interactive web map helps raise awareness to the ongoing issue of veteran suicide as a supplemental tool for the CBS news article.
